    "Take a look at the image below. What do you see? The contours and colors of the image coalesce into an easily nameable percept: a human face. But your percept is likely not so generic; what can you tell me about the face? When we look at such a photograph, in some sense we can't help but _read_ (into) it. There are some features that we can realiably read \"out\" or extract from face photographs, such as age (Henss, 1991; Montepare & Zebrowitz, 1998). However, we also often read \"into\" faces, as when we form (often misguided) impressions of others' personalities solely on the basis of a single image (for a review, see Todorov, 2017). We form these sorts of impressions extraordinarily quickly — many perceived attributes reach reliable self-agreement at only 33-50ms stimulus exposures (e.g., Colombatto, Uddenberg, & Scholl, 2021; Todorov et al., 2009) — and early in life, with some facial impression dimensions coming \"online\" at only 3 years old (Charlesworth et al., 2019). Crucially, such face judgments often show high levels of agreement _between_ perceivers, allowing scientists to create generative models (Gerig et al., 2018; Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008; Peterson, Uddenberg, Griffiths, Todorov, & Suchow, 2022) that can help elucidate not only the features of images driving such impressions, but also the boundary conditions and real-world consequences of such biases (Sutherland et al., 2017). It is important to note that these are not models of reality, but of impression formation — they reflect what (the experimentally sampled) people _think_ an attribute _looks like_ in _particular photographs_ of faces. They act as mirrors that reflect the psychological processes of perceivers, allowing social scientists to transform bias itself into the object of study, or to leverage what we know of how such biases express themselves in order to explore yet subtler effects (Uddenberg & Scholl, 2018). For example, one can use synthetic faces manipulated along perceived attributes to explore how stereotypes propagate, even when there is no evidence for the stereotype at all (Uddenberg, Thompson, Vlasceanu, Griffiths, & Todorov, 2023)."

    "In order to study how we judge, perceive, or remember faces, we must use face stimuli. Broadly speaking, these stimuli can either be \"real\" (e.g., photographs of real-world individuals) or \"synthetic\" (e.g., computer-generated images, drawings, etc.). Both approaches come with tradeoffs. On the one hand, real stimuli are ecologically valid and entirely convincing to participants, but they often lack in diversity (e.g., representing different racialized groups or a wide range of emotional expressions) and ease of experimental control (e.g., requiring the manual use of photo editing software to transform the stimuli in the precise ways one might need). In addition, there are real privacy concerns with using such real-life stimuli — imagine having _your_ photo shown to thousands of strangers to be rated on all sorts of dimensions, perhaps on a job or dating website! — which necessitates restrictions on how they are used in experiments, and sometimes, even how they are presented in papers and conferences (Ma et al., 2015). Lastly, as more and more labs utilize online experiment participant pools, widespread use of face datasets may become (or may already be) a problem, with fewer and fewer (stimulus-)naïve participants available for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, computer-generated impression models have a few key advantages, including the elimination (or, at the very least, _extreme_ mitigation) of privacy concerns in IRB-approved research, as well as greater ease of experimental control. However, there are two salient and common disadvantages: (1) lack of realism — the most popular computer-generated images in use are very obviously computer-generated (Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008) — and (2) lack of accessibility, often being limited to the research group that created them via explicit access controls or implicit technical and knowledge barriers. Last year, we published a paper that, among other things, attempted to mitigate the problem of realism (Peterson et al., 2022). This chapter marks our first step toward solving the latter issue: here, we provide a high level API for the generation, transformation, and inference of face stimuli along dozens of perceived attributes of psychological interest. The face above is one example of the kind of stimuli that you will be able to create by the end of this chapter. This chapter will not cover the details of how these models were made, as they have already been documented in detail. Instead, you may refer to our work in PNAS (Peterson et al., 2022) and NVIDIA's CVPR paper (Karras et al., 2020) if you are interested in understanding the experimental and computational approaches taken."
