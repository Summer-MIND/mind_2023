# MIND Tutorials
*Written by Luke Chang, Jeremy Manning, Mark Thornton, & Matt van der Meer*

The bulk of research in psychology and neuroscience has focused on studying processes within single individuals. However, outside of the laboratory, individuals rarely operate independently but rather in the context of a complex constellation of social relationships. Social interactions form a pervasive and critical aspect of daily life, in settings such as professional and romantic relationships, family interactions, and everyday transactions such as commuting to work and buying groceries. Yet, these settings have received surprisingly little empirical study. This yearâ€™s 2023 MIND Computational Summer School will focus on understanding how minds interact and connect with each other. We will introduce computational techniques to help us understand how we infer the beliefs, goals, intentions, and feelings of other agents, and how this information is communicated to others. Increasingly, it is becoming possible to study these processes in non-human animals, resulting in a productive synergy between researchers working with human and non-human subjects. We will cover topics such as communication, mentalizing, synchronization, social networks, and more.

To meet this need, we have created an online book that includes a collection of the tutorials used in the MIND 2023 summer course.
